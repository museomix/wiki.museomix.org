# YesWiki installation
Not much to it (as long as it works, ahem). Unpack/upload the distribution files
into a directory that can be accessed via the web. Then go to the corresponding URL.  
A web-based installer will walk you through the rest.

#### Example:
If your website, say, http://www.mysite.com, is mapped to the directory /home/jdoe/www/,
and you place the YesWiki distribution files into /home/jdoe/www/wiki/, you should go to
http://www.mysite.com/wiki/.  

IMPORTANT: for installing or upgrading YesWiki, do NOT access any of the files contained
in the setup/ subdirectory. They're used by the web-based installer/updater, but you
should really just access the YesWiki directory itself, and it will (or at least should)
work perfectly.
